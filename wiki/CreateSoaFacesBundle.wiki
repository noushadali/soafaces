#summary How to create a Bundle (soafaces Bundle)

A Bundle (soafaces Bundle) is a simple JAR that contains the classes and resources needed to execute your soafaces Application or Task/Job. Bundles are very powerful and flexible. You can develop a Bundle to serve as an Application that will implement a GUI Application or as a Tasklet that will be part of a Job. In either case the process of developing, packaging, and deploying is very similar.
